## üìñ About the Project
The **Library Management Database** is a PL/SQL-based project designed to manage a library's operations, including book inventory, authors, members, and transactions. It provides a structured database schema and SQL queries to handle data insertion, updates, deletions, and complex retrievals. This project is ideal for learning and practicing database management using Oracle PL/SQL.

### Problem Statement
Libraries face challenges in managing their inventory, tracking members, and handling borrowing transactions efficiently. Manual systems are error-prone, time-consuming, and lack the ability to generate insights from data. The **Library Management Database** addresses these challenges by providing a robust, automated system to:
- Maintain a catalog of books and their authors.
- Track members and their borrowing activities.
- Manage transactions such as borrowing and returning books.
- Generate reports and insights through advanced SQL queries.

This system ensures efficient data management, reduces manual effort, and provides a scalable solution for libraries of all sizes.



## üõ† Built With
### Tech Stack
- **Database**: Oracle PL/SQL
- **Tools**: Oracle SQL Developer, Oracle Database

### Key Features
- **Efficient Data Management**: Handles books, authors, members, and transactions seamlessly.
- **Complex Queries**: Supports advanced SQL operations like joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable to include additional features like publishers or advanced reporting.
