#Problem Statement
This assignment involves designing and implementing a database system to manage various entities such as customers, orders, employees, departments, students, courses, and event tickets. The system is designed to handle relationships between these entities, perform CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete) operations, and execute complex SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights from the data.

#Explanation of Results

-Customer and Order Management: The queries successfully retrieved the total amount spent by each customer, orders placed by specific customers, and customers who haven't placed any orders.

-Employee and Department Management: The queries provided insights into employee salaries, department-wise employee counts, and employees who haven't received any salary.

-Student and Course Management: The queries helped identify the oldest student, courses with the highest enrollment, and students who haven't made any payments.

-Event Ticket Management: The queries successfully listed the most expensive tickets, customers who haven't booked any tickets, and the event with the highest number of tickets sold.

#Conclusion
This assignment provided a comprehensive understanding of SQL query execution, database design, and data management. The queries executed demonstrate the ability to retrieve, update, and analyze data efficiently. The conceptual diagram and screenshots provide a clear overview of the database structure and the results obtained from the queries.
